# rvscheme

A simple LISP system written in C#. Inspired by Scheme and the wonderful [SICP book](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf).

Supports features such as [tail call optmization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) and [call-with-current-continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-with-current-continuation)

Capable of running many programs from the legendary "[Structure and Interpretation Of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)" book.
