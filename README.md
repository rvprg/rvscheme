# rvscheme

A simple LISP system written in C#. Inspired by Scheme. 

Supports features such as tail call optmization and call-with-current-continuation.

Capable of running many programs from the legendary "[Structure and Interpretation Of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)" book.

(A very old pet project.)
